## 📂 Contents

- [`plasmids/GH1/`](https://github.com/3pochs/OpenPlasmid/tree/main/plasmids/GH1) - Expression plasmid for mature Human Growth Hormone 1 (GH1), codon-optimized for *E. coli*
- [`plasmids/EquininB/`](https://github.com/3pochs/OpenPlasmid/tree/main/plasmids/EquininB) - This plasmid is designed for the expression of the Equinin B antimicrobial peptide 
- *(More plasmids coming soon – stay tuned!)*


Each plasmid folder includes:  
- Annotated GenBank file (`.gb`)  
- FASTA sequence file (`.fasta`)  
- Plasmid map image (`.png` or `.svg`)  
- README describing the construct’s purpose, features, and usage
