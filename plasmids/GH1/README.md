# pET28a-GH1 Plasmid

## Overview

This plasmid is designed for the expression of the mature **Human Growth Hormone 1 (GH1)** coding sequence in *Escherichia coli* (E. coli) K12 strains. The GH1 gene is codon-optimized for efficient bacterial expression.

## Features

- **Vector Backbone:** pET28a(+)  
- **Insert:** Mature Homo sapiens GH1 coding sequence  
- **Size:** 5862 bp, circular DNA  
- **Selection Marker:** Kanamycin resistance  
- **Tags:** N-terminal 6xHis tag for protein purification  
- **Cloning Sites:** GH1 insert is cloned between **NdeI** and **XhoI** sites  
- **Restriction Sites Avoided:** EcoRI, BamHI, NcoI, XhoI to preserve cloning integrity

## Usage

- Suitable for recombinant expression of human GH1 in *E. coli* strains compatible with pET28a vectors.  
- Standard IPTG induction protocols for T7 promoter systems apply.  
- Protein purification can be performed via His-tag affinity chromatography.
