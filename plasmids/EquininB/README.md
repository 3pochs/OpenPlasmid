# Equinin B Plasmid

## Overview

This plasmid is designed for the expression of the Equinin B antimicrobial peptide in *Pichia pastoris*. The Equinin B gene is codon-optimized for efficient expression in this yeast host.

## Features

- **Vector Backbone:** pPICZ-alpha A  
- **Insert:** Equinin B antimicrobial peptide coding sequence  
- **Size:** 3718 bp, circular DNA  
- **Selection Marker:** Zeocin resistance (Bleomycin resistance gene)  
- **Tags:** C-terminal Myc epitope tag and 6xHis affinity tag for detection and purification  
- **Promoter:** Methanol-inducible AOX1 promoter  
- **Secretion Signal:** MF-alpha-1 secretion signal for extracellular peptide secretion  
- **Cloning Sites:** Insert optimized and integrated within pPICZ-alpha A backbone  
- **Replication Origin:** ColE1/pMB1 origin for *E. coli* propagation  

## Usage

- Suitable for recombinant expression of Equinin B peptide in *Pichia pastoris* strains compatible with pPICZ vectors.  
- Induce protein expression by adding methanol to cultures to activate AOX1 promoter.  
- Secreted peptide can be purified from culture supernatant using Myc or His tags with standard affinity chromatography techniques.
